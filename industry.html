      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>The ocean industry encompasses a wide range of sectors, including shipping, fishing, tourism, renewable energy, and resource extraction. It is a vital part of the global economy, contributing trillions of dollars and employing millions of people worldwide. Key stakeholders in this industry include companies, governments, environmental organizations, research institutions, local communities, and consumers.</p>

      <button id="accordion-button-2" aria-expanded="false"><span class="accordion-title">Current relationship between the industry and the ocean</span><span class="icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></button>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>The current relationship between the industry and the ocean is complex. While the industry heavily relies on the ocean for resources, transportation, and recreation, its activities also pose significant threats to the marine ecosystem. Pollution, overfishing, habitat destruction, and climate change are among the pressing issues affecting the health and sustainability of the ocean.</p>

      <button id="accordion-button-3" aria-expanded="false"><span class="accordion-title">Potential problems faced by the industry</span><span class="icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></button>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>The industry faces several challenges now and in the future. From a PESTEL analysis, it is evident that political and regulatory pressures will increase to protect the ocean. Economic factors, such as fluctuating resource availability and shifting consumer demands, will require adaptation. Social concerns for sustainability and ethical practices will drive changes in industry practices. Technological advancements and climate change impacts will also shape the future landscape of the industry.</p>

      <button id="accordion-button-4" aria-expanded="false"><span class="accordion-title">Role of stakeholders in industry development</span><span class="icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></button>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>Various stakeholders play critical roles in shaping the industry's future. Governments must enact and enforce policies to promote sustainable practices and protect marine ecosystems. Companies need to adopt environmentally responsible strategies, invest in research and development, and collaborate with other stakeholders. Environmental organizations and research institutions play a crucial role in raising awareness, conducting scientific studies, and advocating for conservation measures. Local communities can contribute by supporting sustainable tourism and participating in conservation efforts.</p>

      <button id="accordion-button-5" aria-expanded="false"><span class="accordion-title">Why is there a sense of urgency for industry and stakeholders?</span><span class="icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></button>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>The urgency to improve the state of the ocean stems from the recognition that the health of the ocean is intrinsically linked to the well-being of our planet and future generations. The ocean provides essential resources, regulates the climate, and supports biodiversity. Without immediate action, irreversible damage could occur, impacting not only the environment but also the economy and livelihoods of millions of people who depend on the ocean.</p>

					<h2>Role of Citizen Scientists</h2>
          <p>Various data users would be interested in the data collected by citizen scientists in the industry. Scientists and researchers can utilize the data to study and monitor changes in the marine environment, identify trends, and assess the effectiveness of conservation measures. Policymakers can use the data to inform decision-making and develop evidence-based regulations. Environmental organizations can leverage the data for advocacy and awareness campaigns. Businesses can gain insights into sustainable practices, consumer preferences, and potential risks and opportunities related to the ocean.</p>
        <p>Each stakeholder group has unique needs and motivations. To enable their participation, a human-centered design approach should be adopted. This involves creating user-friendly platforms, providing training and resources, and ensuring that their efforts are recognized and valued.</p>
